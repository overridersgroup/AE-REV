CAMPAIGN_TUTORIAL_NAME=Tutorial
CAMPAIGN_TUTORIAL_STAGE_1_NAME=Move & Attack
CAMPAIGN_TUTORIAL_STAGE_1_OBJECTIVE_1=VICTORY: Defeat all enemy units.
CAMPAIGN_TUTORIAL_STAGE_1_OBJECTIVE_2=DEFEAT: Your commander is defeated.
CAMPAIGN_TUTORIAL_STAGE_1_MESSAGE_1=Welcome new commander! I am a trainer from military camp. In this stage I will teach you the most basic of battle: move and attack.
CAMPAIGN_TUTORIAL_STAGE_1_MESSAGE_2=As you can see you are on the left side of the map and there are two enemies on the right side which you need to defeat.
CAMPAIGN_TUTORIAL_STAGE_1_MESSAGE_3=However your movement point is not enough to reach them, so lets move to the village in the middle of the map first.
CAMPAIGN_TUTORIAL_STAGE_1_MESSAGE_4=To move a unit, you need to click it first and some yellow squares will appear on the map showing where you can move.
CAMPAIGN_TUTORIAL_STAGE_1_MESSAGE_5=By moving the cursor to one of the yellow squares a path to the destination will appear. Click the destination to move there.
CAMPAIGN_TUTORIAL_STAGE_1_MESSAGE_6=Now it's time for practice, move your commander to the village in the middle!
CAMPAIGN_TUTORIAL_STAGE_1_MESSAGE_7=Good, now you can click the standby button (the button with a down arrow icon) to let your commander standby.
CAMPAIGN_TUTORIAL_STAGE_1_MESSAGE_8=And since there's nothing for you to do you can click the 'End Turn' button on the bottom right corner after you standby your commander to end your turn.
CAMPAIGN_TUTORIAL_STAGE_1_MESSAGE_9=Now it's time for you to attack the enemies. To attack an enemy, move your commander next to him and a button with a sword icon will appear.
CAMPAIGN_TUTORIAL_STAGE_1_MESSAGE_10=Click this button then move the cursor to one of the enemies within attack range and click the enemy to attack.
CAMPAIGN_TUTORIAL_STAGE_1_MESSAGE_11=Great, now you have have learned how to move and attack, there's nothing to hold you back. Destroy all the enemies to win the stage!

CAMPAIGN_TUTORIAL_STAGE_2_NAME=Repair, Occupy & Recruit
CAMPAIGN_TUTORIAL_STAGE_2_OBJECTIVE_1=VICTORY: Defeat all enemy units.
CAMPAIGN_TUTORIAL_STAGE_2_OBJECTIVE_2=DEFEAT: Your commander is defeated.
CAMPAIGN_TUTORIAL_STAGE_2_MESSAGE_1=Welcome to a new stage! In this stage I will teach you all the things about repair, occupy and recruit.
CAMPAIGN_TUTORIAL_STAGE_2_MESSAGE_2=You can see there are many enemy units on the other side of the river and they are too many for your commander to defeat.
CAMPAIGN_TUTORIAL_STAGE_2_MESSAGE_3=So you need a castle to recruit units to help you fight the enemies. And fortunately there's a castle near the bottom of the map. Let's go for that.
CAMPAIGN_TUTORIAL_STAGE_2_MESSAGE_4=To occupy this castle, you need to move your commander above it and click the occupy button (button with a house icon).
CAMPAIGN_TUTORIAL_STAGE_2_MESSAGE_5=Good, now this castle is yours, it will provide 100 gold per turn and you can use it to recruit units to fight enemies.
CAMPAIGN_TUTORIAL_STAGE_2_MESSAGE_6=But don't be so hasty, there are two village ruins near the castle, so let's recruit some soldiers to repair them first.
CAMPAIGN_TUTORIAL_STAGE_2_MESSAGE_7=To recruit a unit, just click the castle then choose the unit you want to recruit and click the 'Recruit' button.
CAMPAIGN_TUTORIAL_STAGE_2_MESSAGE_8=Now it's time for practice, since repair action is quite similar to occupy action, I think you can try it yourself.
CAMPAIGN_TUTORIAL_STAGE_2_MESSAGE_9=Great, since each occupied village can provide 50 gold per turn, make sure to occupy them on your next turn.
CAMPAIGN_TUTORIAL_STAGE_2_MESSAGE_10=And it seems there are still some gold left so try recruiting some more units to strengthen your army.
CAMPAIGN_TUTORIAL_STAGE_2_MESSAGE_11=Fantastic, now you have gained more income and there's no need to fear the enemies. Destroy all the enemies to win the stage!

CAMPAIGN_TUTORIAL_STAGE_3_NAME=Prepare for battle!
CAMPAIGN_TUTORIAL_STAGE_3_OBJECTIVE_1=VICTORY: Defeat all enemy units and capture enemy castle.
CAMPAIGN_TUTORIAL_STAGE_3_OBJECTIVE_2=DEFEAT: Your commander is defeated.
CAMPAIGN_TUTORIAL_STAGE_3_MESSAGE_1=Now it's time for you to put what you have learned into real battle. As you can see enemies also have a commander and a castle which means they are more difficult to defeat then before.
CAMPAIGN_TUTORIAL_STAGE_3_MESSAGE_2=The key to victory is units' properties and abilities. If you pay attention to that then the battle can be more easier.
CAMPAIGN_TUTORIAL_STAGE_3_MESSAGE_3=To give a brief explanation, there are two types of attack: physical & magic and one unit can only have one type of attack. Physical attack power will be displayed in red while magic in blue.
CAMPAIGN_TUTORIAL_STAGE_3_MESSAGE_4=And each unit also have physical and magic defence. Physical defence has a red shield icon while magic defence has a blue one.
CAMPAIGN_TUTORIAL_STAGE_3_MESSAGE_5=So while attacking, remember to choose your opponent wisely. If you choose an enemy weak to your unit's attack type, then you can deal more damage.
CAMPAIGN_TUTORIAL_STAGE_3_MESSAGE_6=Also there are two more units available for recruiting in this stage: element & sorceress.
CAMPAIGN_TUTORIAL_STAGE_3_MESSAGE_7=Elements are made of pure aqua, so they can fight much better when in water. And sorceresses can summon skeletons from fallen units which turns out to be quite useful.
CAMPAIGN_TUTORIAL_STAGE_3_MESSAGE_8=Keep those in mind, use what you have learned in previous stages to defeat all enemies and capture their castle!
CAMPAIGN_TUTORIAL_STAGE_3_MESSAGE_9=Fantastic, it seems you are getting better at battle. But do not grow arrogant, you still have a long road to go.
CAMPAIGN_TUTORIAL_STAGE_3_MESSAGE_10=There are many more units and abilities for you to explore. Remember to check the in-game wiki if you have any questions. Good journey to you!

CAMPAIGN_AEII_STAGE_8_MESSAGE_10=Pitiful wretches. You will not live long enough to see your precious Kingdom engulfed in shadow...

CAMPAIGN_AEII_STAGE_8_MESSAGE_12=In your insignificant life and narrow mind, perhaps... Nevertheless everything is now set in motion - the invisible forces that govern time are beyond your knowledge. You cannot stop me from rising again!
CAMPAIGN_AEII_STAGE_8_MESSAGE_13=Your Majesty, the Ruins are falling apart! We should leave immediately!
CAMPAIGN_AEII_STAGE_8_MESSAGE_14=But the Crystals... They are still in there!
CAMPAIGN_AEII_STAGE_8_MESSAGE_15=The only thing we can save now is ourselves!
CAMPAIGN_AEII_STAGE_8_MESSAGE_16=You have served me well. Now move!

EDITOR_ERROR_ATT=At least 2 teams!
EDITOR_ERROR_THOMC=Team %s has more then one commander!
EDITOR_ERROR_FSM=Failed saving the map!

UNIT_DESCRIPTION_0=A simple soldier capable of capturing and repairing houses. Very simple, isn't it?
UNIT_DESCRIPTION_1=Archers are a great offensive ranged unit, but a shame in head-to-head matches.
UNIT_DESCRIPTION_2=Water Monsters are aquatic friends who can cross the sea in no time. They are very strong if they attack from the water.
UNIT_DESCRIPTION_3=Sorceresses are weak in melee combat but they can summon skeletons from the dead to aid you in the battle.
UNIT_DESCRIPTION_4=These mystical beings of pure light have an aura that can remove negative effects from your allies and heal them a little bit.
UNIT_DESCRIPTION_5=Raptors are swift and very powerful birds, but they are very sensitive to damage from archers.
UNIT_DESCRIPTION_6=Golems are ancient beings, incredibly strong in physical defence and are even stronger when in the mountains.
UNIT_DESCRIPTION_7=Orball Archers are trained by the ancient tribes to strike at an incredible distance: this requires, however, maximum concentration.
UNIT_DESCRIPTION_8=These massive flying beasts have ruled the sky since ancient times. They have very high motility and deadly melee attacks.
UNIT_DESCRIPTION_9=Commander is the heart of an army. He has quite strong battle skills and can capture enemy castles.
UNIT_DESCRIPTION_10=Skeletons are undead beings summoned by necromancers. They are not very strong but have poisonous attacks.
UNIT_DESCRIPTION_11=<none>
UNIT_DESCRIPTION_12=Paladins are holy armies who are skilled at healing and can also capture villages like soldiers do.
UNIT_DESCRIPTION_13=Barbarians are born fighters. The more enemies are around them the stronger they become.
UNIT_DESCRIPTION_14=Ghosts are mystical undead beings. They float above the ground and can blind enemies with their attacks.
UNIT_DESCRIPTION_15=Black mages are skilled at using dark magic. Their attacks are always powerful against those with low magic defence.
UNIT_DESCRIPTION_16=They are extremely fast, silent and painful: wolves are difficult to catch. Their house is the forest.
UNIT_DESCRIPTION_17=Blops are large jellies capable of inflicting good damage, despite taking on a role as a defender in the water.
UNIT_DESCRIPTION_18=A classic slime, capable of absorbing damage against small enemies.
UNIT_DESCRIPTION_19=A civilian from your village, who will occupy other villages. Ehm, don't think he's useful in combat.
UNIT_DESCRIPTION_20=Who steals villages better than a thief?
UNIT_DESCRIPTION_21=Why you should steal houses from the enemy if you can destroy them?
UNIT_DESCRIPTION_22=Born of hatred of bows, the Lancer uses his spear to ward off enemies.
UNIT_DESCRIPTION_23=Like the classic Lancer, but with a consistent armor.
UNIT_DESCRIPTION_24=Attack sorceress capable of resurrecting the dead through the ancient rites of Orball.
UNIT_DESCRIPTION_25=Agile and powerful warrior, capable of striking even from a medium distance.
UNIT_DESCRIPTION_26=Impenetrable, indestructible: the perfect tank for wreaking havoc in enemy villages.
UNIT_DESCRIPTION_27=Weak bats, but quick to attack dying units.
UNIT_DESCRIPTION_28=If the skeleton is not your thing, then the warrior skeleton is perfect: his shield will prevent his quick return to the world of the deads.
UNIT_DESCRIPTION_29=Who ever said skeletons can't practice dark magic?
UNIT_DESCRIPTION_30=Invoked through ancient rites, the Demon will learn to destroy by attacking the enemy more and more.
UNIT_DESCRIPTION_31=Coming from faraway lands, the Viking adapts to many terrains and gladly helps his companions in need.

UNIT_GUIDE_0=Soldiers are very useful in the early game, they can capture or repair villages to give you advantage. Although soldiers are not very powerful fighters, they can deal some decent damages to enemies with low physical defence.
UNIT_GUIDE_1=Archers start with quite low attack power, but due to their long attack range you can level them up more easily then soldiers. As they level up their attack will be more powerful. Meanwhile archers are also good at destroying air forces.
UNIT_GUIDE_2=Water Monsters can move and fight much more efficiently in the water, so if you are planning to pick up a fight in places covered by water element is a good choice.
UNIT_GUIDE_3=Sorceresses can summon skeletons from fallen units, so if the battle goes intense and many units die it's a good idea to recruit sorceresses. But since sorceresses are weak against physical melee attacks you should move them smartly.
UNIT_GUIDE_4=The refresh aura of Light can remove negative effects from allies nearby as well as heal them a bit. Note that Lights can fight better in forest but are weak against archers.
UNIT_GUIDE_5=Raptors have deadly physical attacks and can move swiftly on land, so you can use them to destroy enemy key units quickly.
UNIT_GUIDE_6=Golems have very high physical defence and become even tougher when in mountains so they are good at defending enemies' physical attacks. However golems have relatively low magic defence so keep them away from enemy magic users.
UNIT_GUIDE_7=Orball Archers have a very long attack range so you can use them to destroy enemy back lines. But they are very slow, so they cannot attack once moved so you have to protect them properly.
UNIT_GUIDE_8=Dragons are powerful air forces, they can move through all terrains easily and destroy enemies with their deadly attacks. Note that dragons' melee attacks can be even more deadly so make sure to put that in good use.
UNIT_GUIDE_9=Commanders can capture enemy castles which is the key to victory. But since you cannot do that at the beginning and commander's recruiting price increases every time they die, you will want to protect him and level him up as much as you can.
UNIT_GUIDE_10=Skeletons have very low attack power which means they are not good at dealing instant damages. But it's always a good idea trying to use skeletons to apply poison status to enemy key units.
UNIT_GUIDE_11=<none>
UNIT_GUIDE_12=Note that paladins' heal can exceed allies' max HP so you can use them to increase the attack power of your allies. Also paladins' heal can become holy damage to skeletons so you can use them to kill skeletons and avoid being poisoned.
UNIT_GUIDE_13=Since the more enemies are around the more attack power and physical defence Barbarians gain, so when you are outnumbered try to recruit some Barbarians. Also Barbarians' attack aura can make your allies stronger and avoid negative affects.
UNIT_GUIDE_14=Since ghosts are undead beings they are not afraid of poisons. And since ghosts can blind enemies it's always a good idea try to use them to attack enemy units with high attack damage.
UNIT_GUIDE_15=Black mages have no abilities but they have quite high magic attack which makes them good magic damage dealers. However black mages are not that good at melee combat so try to use them wisely.
UNIT_GUIDE_16=Due to their high mobility, you can use Wolves to destroy enemy forces quite easily no matter they are in back line or front line. And with their ability to blind targets they are also good at silencing enemy high attack units.
UNIT_GUIDE_17=Blops have quite long attack range and have rehabilitation ability which means they will be very strong on the water. But even on land they are still good magic damage dealers.
UNIT_GUIDE_18=Slimes are best against ranged attacks, but they are weak in melee battle so try to use them wisely.

WIKI_OVERVIEW_P1=What you see now is the in-game wiki which is designed to help you learn how to play this game. Please check the following sections for more information.

WIKI_GAMEPLAY_OBJECTIVES_P1=For skirmish games the objectives are quite simple, you need to eliminate all enemy units and capture all enemy castles (excluding the neutral ones). To achieve this you need to recruit units and fight enemy armies with some strategies.
WIKI_GAMEPLAY_OBJECTIVES_P2=However for campaigns the objectives can be more complicated which you need to pay attention to.

WIKI_GAMEPLAY_RECRUITING_P1=You can recruit units from your castles. However you can only recruit units when there's no unit on the castle except your commander. Recruiting units will cost you gold coins and each unit will take up a certain amount of unit capacity. So remember to check that before recruiting a unit.
WIKI_GAMEPLAY_RECRUITING_P2=However for commanders it is a little different. Firstly you can only recruit commander when your commander has fallen in the battle. Secondly commander's recruiting price will increase by 100 every time he dies.
WIKI_GAMEPLAY_RECRUITING_P3=Note that even if you have reached maximum unit capacity, you can still recruit your fallen commander.

WIKI_GAMEPLAY_ATTACKING_P1=To attack an enemy, you need to select and move a unit toward that enemy. And as long as that enemy is within your unit's attack range, you can attack him.
WIKI_GAMEPLAY_ATTACKING_P2=There are two attack types: physical (attack displayed in red) and magic (attack displayed in blue), and there are also two defence types: physical defence (red shield icon) and magic defence (blue shield icon). So you should always try to attack an enemy weak to your unit's attack type. 
WIKI_GAMEPLAY_ATTACKING_P3=When it comes to counter attack, the story is a bit different. Unit who can perform melee attack can always counter melee attacks. But ranged attacks cannot be countered. Keep that in mind when you decide to attack an enemy.
WIKI_GAMEPLAY_ATTACKING_P4=Note that when attacking, the lower a unit's HP is, the less damage this unit can make.

WIKI_GAMEPLAY_HEALING_P1=Units with healing related abilities can heal allies. Some heals can exceed target's max HP, but the exceeded HP will be removed when the unit standby or when his turn starts.
WIKI_GAMEPLAY_HEALING_P2=Note that there's a restriction for healing, that is, the ground units cannot heal flying units, but flying units can heal everyone.

WIKI_GAMEPLAY_INCOME_P1=Your income mainly comes from villages and castles. Each village can give you 50 gold coins per turn while each castle can give you 100. So try to capture as many villages and castles as you can to gain advantage against enemies.
WIKI_GAMEPLAY_INCOME_P2=Note that if your commander is alive he can also give you some incomes. The base income of a commander is 50 gold coins per turn, which will be increased by 50 every time your commander levels up.

WIKI_GAMEPLAY_STATUS_P1=Some units can attach status to other units, which is an important fact you need to consider about when fighting enemies.
WIKI_GAMEPLAY_STATUS_P2=Note that when a unit is attached one type of status then this unit is immune to other types of status, but when it comes to the same type of status it will refresh the remaining turns of that status.

WIKI_MULTIPLAYER_CREATE_GAME_P1=To create a multiplayer game you need to connect to a server first and it will lead you to the game lobby. By clicking the create button you can create either a new game or a game from a saving file.
WIKI_MULTIPLAYER_CREATE_GAME_P2=To create a new game you need to choose a map, set the start gold, unit capacity and of course the maximum number of players alowed for this game (incluing spectators). However to create a game from save files you only need to set the maximum number of players alowed for this game.
WIKI_MULTIPLAYER_CREATE_GAME_P3=After you have set up your game click create button then it will lead you to the game room where you can wait for other players to join your game and make the final team adjustment.
WIKI_MULTIPLAYER_CREATE_GAME_P4=Also you can set a password for your game while you do not want unexpected players to join the game.

WIKI_MULTIPLAYER_JOIN_GAME_P1=While you are in the game lobby, you can see the list of available game rooms. To join a game is quite simple, first make sure that the room is not full, then select it and click join button. If the room has a password then a dialog will popup to let you input the password.
WIKI_MULTIPLAYER_JOIN_GAME_P2=You can leave the game any time by clicking the leave button while you are still in the game room. However if the game is started and you are not a spectator, we suggest that you finish the game before leaving.

WIKI_MULTIPLAYER_COMMANDS_ASSIGN_P1=Room masters can use this command to assign team to players when the game is started. To do this you need to click the message button on the top left corner of the screen then a dialog containing a player list will appear. Select a player then click send message button and input '/assign 0', this will assign team blue to the player you selected. Note that if there is already a player playing that team then he will lose control to that team.
WIKI_MULTIPLAYER_COMMANDS_ASSIGN_P2=Team value: 0-team blue, 1-team red, 2-team green, 3-team black

WIKI_ABOUT_P1=This game is created by toyknight and the project was started since June 2014.
